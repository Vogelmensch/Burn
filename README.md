### &#x1F3F0; The Mine
Ellen wakes up in the deep mines of the castle. Her shackles are loose, but the only path to freedom leads through the darkness beneath her prison. Damp walls and forgotten tunnels stretch out before her, flooded with shadows and the echo of ancient voices.
The path winds through narrow tunnels, past collapsing bridges and deep ravines. 
Her goal is the crystal! Burn it to reach the exit.
